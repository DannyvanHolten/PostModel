# WordPress Models
Multiple Models for you to use to when developing with WordPress. These models include Posts, Terms & Users.
The WordPress Models simulate are creating a way to use the WP_Query in a consistent way that fits inside the MVC Model.

## Roadmap
- Create documentation on GitHub
- Make it possible to add to / overwrite certain classes so you can still use the same class with an editted on version of the class (Facades)
